    <p>
        Examsearch.ie is designed to provide an intuitive user interface for accessing past exam papers. This site does not store any past examination material, but instead presents links to <a href="http://examinations.ie">examinations.ie</a> or <a href="http://archive.maths.nuim.ie">archive.maths.nuim.ie</a> where these documents are stored. Examsearch.ie has no control over these sites and therefore cannot predict whether document locations will change, resulting in broken/dead links. Please use the contact form if you find any, so they can be rectified. <br><br>

        Thank you
